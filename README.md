### Hi there 👋, My name is Nick. 
## This is my first attempt at a custom Project Portfolio

The links may not work because they are tied to several freeCodeCamp modules.
Over the next few days/weeks, while applying for jobs, I will be updating this page with new projects
that showcase my developing skills.

Thanks for checking it out!

### Updated late 7/7/23

Rewrote some redundant code, stylized, added tier list project
